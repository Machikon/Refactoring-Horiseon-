# Refactoring the existing website of Horiseon
I reviewed and refactored the existing HTMK and CSS for improved accessibility and SEO. Here are the summary of the project.
* Implemented semantic HTML for the code to be more descriptive.
* Added a description of image (alt attributes) for each image.
* Renamed title from "Website" to "Horiseon - SEO & Web Marketing ad Management" for website optimization.
* Aded viewport meta tag in Head for proper view on any devices. 
* Changed/added heading attributes (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
